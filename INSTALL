Install
-------

* UNIX/LINUX

As usual, edit the 'Makefile' in the 'src' sub-directory to fit your needs
(besides, it shouldn't be necessary), and then run 'make'. Finally, just run
'make install' (you may need root privileges for this), or simply copy the
beaver binary in a directory which is in your path (like '/bin', '/usr/bin'
or '/usr/local/bin'). Run 'beaver' and enjoy!
And don't forget to have a look at the '.bl' files examples that you can find
in the 'bl' directory ('.bl' files are used by Beaver to generate tags
insertion menus in the 'Languages' menu).

In a nutshell, the recommended method is:

beaver$ cd src
beaver/src$ emacs Makefile        # Be sure you checked DESTDIR
beaver/src$ make
beaver/src$ make install


* WINDOWS

Still experimental... and probably always will!

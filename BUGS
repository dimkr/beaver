Known problems/bugs:

  - Text widget is sometimes blinking when you type

  - Text widget is scrolling when:
      * the string which is searched for (with a "Find" action) is
        located far away from the current cursor position
      * the langage is manually changed (with the "Language" menu) while
        the cursor is far away from the beginning of the buffer

Note: The bugs related to the GTK 1.2 text widget are rather due to GTK
      limitations than mistakes we would have done in our code. A port
      to GTK 2 would probably represent a big improvement.

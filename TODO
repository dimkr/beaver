Priorities (in a more or less chaotic order):

* Documentation
* Complete preferences system (better management of the '.bl' files)
* Port to GTK 2 (which has a decent text widget) or use GTK 1.2 along with
  Scintilla (www.scintilla.org)
* New highlighting engine
* Improved Search Engine (regexp)
* Compress datas used by the undo/redo code
* Customizable toolbar
* Lots of '.bl' files for the customizable Languages menu
  (would you contribute ?)
* New functionalities (diff, mail, RCS, CVS, ...)
* Any suggestion ???

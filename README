Beaver 0.2.7
Marc Bevand, Damien Terrier and Emmanuel Turquin, 2000-2003


INTRODUCTION
------------
  First of all, many thanks for your interest in Beaver. Beaver is an Early
AdVanced EditoR, for Linux and other Unices (and even Windows); in other words,
it's a text editor that is lightweight but full of features for programming,
from web authoring to C programming. It is based on the GTK+ toolkit, supports
tons of languages through config files (100% compatible with UltraEdit
'wordfile.txt' -- see ultraedit.com for more informations) and offers
functions such as automatic indentation, correction and completion, or syntax
highlighting. It also has its own mini macro language.
Beaver is released under the GNU General Public License and has been started
as an end-of-year project for our second year at the french computing school
EPITA. Of course, any remark or advice (or even contribution) are the welcome!
